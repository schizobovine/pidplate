pidplate
========

Arduino-ish PID temperature controller for a hotplate based solder reflow-ing thingy.

hardware - Contains the Eagle schematic and board layout
firmware - Arduino sketch & makefile to build code to run it

Bill of materials still TODO, as I haven't really finalized each part, but know
the footprints for each and want to get the board to the fab before I grow old.
